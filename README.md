# 👋 Welcome to Your Expo App

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## ⚡ Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

You'll then be prompted to open the app in:

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/), so you can start building features in the `app/` directory.

## 🧼 Reset Project

Want a fresh start?

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the starter code to `app-example/` and gives you a clean `app/` folder to begin with.
